Hi, I’m @h20ld3n — I create beautiful, exciting, and positive experiences by working with inspired and driven people.

Over the last twenty years, I have produced award-winning strategic marketing campaigns. I am an experienced art and creative director who has led high-performing teams at companies across various industries. Working with inspired and driven individuals, I aspire to create beautiful, exciting, and positive experiences. Whether it is bringing people together through an application or developing a dynamic brand to change the world, I believe that inspired teams yield inspirational results.

🌱 I’m currently learning.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design projects.
